### Hi! I'm Maddi, a passionate physics major and software engineer.
My heart lies in the potential of quantum computing and machine learning to transform the world of orbital calibrations for satellites and manned spacecraft. I'm currently exploring machine learning and quantum algorithms, which I'm exicted to make use of in future projects.
